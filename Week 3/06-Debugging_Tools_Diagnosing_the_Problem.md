## Something's Wrong!
Indications that something's not right
* message: A generic notification/diagnostic message produced by the message function; execution of the function continues
* warning: An indication that something is wrong but not necessarily fatal; execution of the function continues; generated by the warning function
* error: An indication that a fatal problem has occurred; execution stops; produced by the stop function
* condition: A generic concept for indicating that something unexpected can occur; programmers can create their own conditions

Warning

How do you konw that something is wrong with your function?
* What was your input? How did you call the function?
* What were you expecting? Output, messages, other results?
* What did you get?
* How does what you get differe from what you were expecting?
* Were your expectations correct in the first place?
* Can you reproduce the problem (exactly)?
